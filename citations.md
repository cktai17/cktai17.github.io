Proper citation is a vital part of scholarship in history and philosophy of science. Citation serves two purposes. As in other scientific fields, your work builds upon and contributes to an existing body of work. Citing these works shows who you are in conversation with and gives credit to those whose work influenced yours. However, there is another reason why works get cited in historical scholarship, it is because often written documents are your sources. By providing proper referencing to these sources, you provide transparency because your readers can go back to the original sources to investigate these themselves.

There are two main ways that sources get cited in historical and philosophical scholarships. The first method is by providing the sources within the text. This is called in-text citation and is more common in philosophical scholarship. The second is by providing the sources in notes, which is more common in historical scholarship.

In either case, citations need the following basic elements:
- author(s) and/or editor(s)
- title
- date of publication (usually just the year)
- publication information
	- for books you provide the publisher
	- for journal articles you provide the journal title, volume and/or issue, and page numbers of the article
	- for newspaper articles you provide the newspaper title, the edition (if applicable), and the exact date of publication
	- for chapters within books, you provide the book information and the page numbers of the chapter.
	- for webpages and blogs you provide the stable url. 
These basic elements ensure that your readers can find your sources if they want to read them. Some style guides require additional elements like the doi or the location of the publisher.

## In-text citations
The basic idea of in-text citation is to provide the full sources in a bibliography and then refer to these sources by a shorthand in the text. Again there are two main ways for providing the short hand. The common way in the humanities is to provide the author, year, and relevant pages in parentheses. This is called author-year. A popular style for author year citations is provided by the American Psychological Association (https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references/examples).

Example:
```

In the sciences, it is common to assign a specific code to each article and reference this code in the text. This can be some sort of abbreviation or just simply a number. A popular example of latter is the style provided by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (http://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/IEEE_Reference_Guide.pdf).

The best way to insert chapters into windycity is by first making the book collection and then creating a book chapter that references this collection. That ensures that all the data from the book collection is inserted in the right categories.

The reason for this is that windycity is far more versatile than any other biblatex style. It makes it possible to include an editor for a specific chapter with a named author within a books by a different author that is edited by yet another person as editor. To keep track of this, windycity creates new categories ,like `editora` for book editors. You could enter book chapters into your `.bib` file without cross referencing by making use of these categories, but this makes the `.bib` file incompatible with other biblatex styles.
